# Getting started

Install the core package:

```bash
pip install python-sendparcel
```

`python-sendparcel` is framework-agnostic and exposes:

- shipment protocols and shared types
- provider base class and plugin registry
- shipment flow orchestration
- built-in `sendparcel.providers.dummy.DummyProvider` for local testing
